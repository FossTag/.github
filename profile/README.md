# FossTag - Free and Open Source Laser Tag System

A free software and open hardware project to create a laser tag system.

> **Warning:** This is starting off as an educational system for me (@pserwylo) to learn electronics. I hope one day it will evolve into something usable by others.

## Components

### Tagger

### Sensor

### Other ideas

This project has a lot of potential for building cool and interesting components.
Depending on how successful we are with the Tagger and Sensor, then it would be good to investigate some of the following ideas.

#### Target

Static targets which can be shot by taggers and respond both visually and with audio feedback.

Potential uses could be for calibrating tagger, practice ranges, or additional point scoring during games.

#### Capture the Flag

A beacon which can be captured by players and returned to a base. It would use some form of proximity sensor to know when it was returned, indicating the game is won by one particular team.

Would probably need some sort of broader interaction with a game server to keep track of the whole game state.

#### Grenade

Devies which have multiple IR LEDs facing outward on all angles, and are robust enough to be thrown.

After pressing a button then it will wait a certain amount of time before firing (e.g. using a capacitor or 555 in monostable mode).

#### Trip wire

Either a physical wire which when tripped will trip a switch when knocked, or an infrared version which works like a long distance optocoupler.
